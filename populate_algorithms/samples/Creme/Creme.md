# Online Machine Learning Algorithm using Creme (River) Library

## Introduction

`creme` (now known as `river`) is a Python library for online machine learning. Online machine learning is a method where the model is trained incrementally by feeding data instances one at a time, allowing the model to adapt to new data dynamically. This is particularly useful for scenarios where data arrives in a stream and where it is impractical to retrain the model from scratch frequently.

## Basic Concepts

### Model

In `creme`, a model can be any predictive algorithm that supports incremental learning. Common models include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and more.

### Pipeline

A pipeline in `creme` consists of a sequence of data transformations followed by a model. This allows for preprocessing and modeling steps to be applied in a seamless and efficient manner.

### Metrics

Metrics in `creme` are used to evaluate the performance of the model incrementally. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and more.

### Data Streams

Data streams in `creme` refer to the continuous flow of data that is fed into the model for training and prediction. This is typically handled using a loop that processes each data instance sequentially.

## Example Algorithm

Below is an example algorithm using the `creme` library for online linear regression:

### 1. Installation

First, install the `creme` library (note that the library has been renamed to `river`):

```sh
pip install river
```

### 2. Import Libraries
```py
from river import linear_model
from river import datasets
from river import metrics
from river import compose
```

### 3. Define the Model and Pipeline
```py
model = linear_model.LinearRegression()
```
### 4. Define the Metric
```py
metric = metrics.MAE()  # Mean Absolute Error
```
### 5. Stream Data and Train the Model
```py
dataset = datasets.TrumpApproval()

for x, y in dataset:
    y_pred = model.predict_one(x)  # Make a prediction
    model.learn_one(x, y)          # Update the model
    metric.update(y, y_pred)       # Update the metric
    print(f'MAE: {metric.get()}')
```

## Detailed Steps
### Initialization
Initialize the model and metric. Here, we use LinearRegression for the model and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for evaluation.

### Data Streaming
Use a dataset provided by creme (e.g., TrumpApproval). This dataset provides a stream of data instances.

### Model Training and Evaluation
For each data instance:

- Predict the output using model.predict_one(x).
- Update the model with the true output using model.learn_one(x, y).
- Update the metric with the true and predicted outputs using metric.update(y, y_pred).
- Print the updated metric.

## Applications
Online machine learning using creme can be applied in various domains, such as:

- Finance: Predicting stock prices based on streaming financial data.
- IoT: Analyzing sensor data in real-time for predictive maintenance.
- Marketing: Personalizing recommendations based on user interactions.

## Conclusion
The creme (now river) library provides a powerful and flexible framework for online machine learning in Python. By processing data incrementally, models can adapt to new information in real-time, making them suitable for dynamic and continuously evolving datasets.
