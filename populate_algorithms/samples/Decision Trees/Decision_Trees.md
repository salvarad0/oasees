# Decision Trees Algorithm

## Introduction

Decision Trees are a popular supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the data space into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

## How Decision Trees Work

1. **Root Node**: The top node of the tree represents the entire dataset. The best feature to split the data is chosen based on a criterion such as Gini impurity or information gain.

2. **Splitting**: The dataset is divided into subsets based on the selected feature. Each subset forms a branch of the tree.

3. **Internal Nodes**: Each internal node represents a feature and a decision rule. The data continues to split recursively at each internal node.

4. **Leaf Nodes**: When a subset can no longer be split or a stopping criterion is met, a leaf node is created. Each leaf node represents a class label (for classification) or a value (for regression).

## Key Concepts

### 1. Gini Impurity

Gini impurity measures the likelihood of an incorrect classification of a new instance if it was randomly classified according to the distribution of the class labels in the subset. It is calculated as:

$$ Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2 $$

where $$ \p_i $$ is the probability of an element being classified to a particular class.

### 2. Information Gain

Information gain measures the reduction in entropy or impurity after a dataset is split on an attribute. It is calculated as:

$$ IG(T, A) = Entropy(T) - \sum_{v \in Values(A)} \frac{|T_v|}{|T|} \times Entropy(T_v) $$

where $$ T $$ is the set of data, $$ A $$ is the attribute, and $$ T_v $$ is the subset of data for which attribute $$ A $$ has value $$ v $$.

### 3. Entropy

Entropy is a measure of the disorder or uncertainty in the data. It is given by:

$$ Entropy(S) = - \sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \log_2 p_i $$

where $$ p_i $$ is the probability of class $$ i $$ in set $$ S $$.

## Advantages

- **Easy to Understand**: Decision trees are simple to understand and visualize.
- **Non-Parametric**: They do not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data.
- **Feature Importance**: They provide a clear indication of which features are most important for prediction.

## Disadvantages

- **Overfitting**: Decision trees can easily overfit the training data if not properly pruned.
- **Instability**: Small changes in the data can result in a completely different tree.
- **Bias**: They can be biased towards features with more levels.

## Pruning

Pruning is a technique used to reduce the size of the tree and prevent overfitting. It involves removing branches that have little importance and do not provide additional power to classify instances.

### Types of Pruning

- **Pre-Pruning**: Stops the tree from growing once it reaches a certain size or a specific condition.
- **Post-Pruning**: Removes branches from a fully grown tree based on certain criteria.

## Applications

- **Classification**: Email spam detection, loan default prediction, medical diagnosis.
- **Regression**: Predicting house prices, stock price forecasting.

## Conclusion

Decision Trees are a versatile and powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. Despite their simplicity and interpretability, care must be taken to avoid overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to new data.
